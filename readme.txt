Add an "About Me" widget to your sidebar.

== Description ==
Since I don't consider my blog anonymous or 'seekrit' I grabbed a text widget and started adding an "About Me" to my sidebar. After trying to get things aligned, formatted, and adding a few links I started thinking a widget might be nice for this. Et voila. This was my first-ever widget, so I appreciate your patience ;')

Now, with over 8000 downloads I am releasing what I hope to be a more friendly widget. The biggest issues previously were related to path(s), layout and alignment. This left me wanting to re-design the configuration interface, keeping in mind a lot of users know little about HTML/CSS and validity issues, yet allowing the geekier to get into details/code if so desired.

After a lot of hours designing, testing and uttering quite a few curses, my head finally popped out of my sphincter and I decided to use what WordPress uses: TinyMCE. WordPress users are at least somewhat familiar with it, it's already 'built-in' (no extra libraries/scripts) and I soon discovered it was easily configurable. Actually it's easily configurable AFTER you've learned how. Before, it's a bitch.

So here it is. The New King Hell Deluxe About Me Widget Supreme (ymmv)

== Installation ==
To install:

1) Drop the AboutMe folder into your wp-content/plugins folder

2) Go to your Administration:Plugins page and activate the About Me Widget


To configure:

1) Go to Presentation:Widgets

2) Move (drag and drop) the widget to where you would like it in your active sidebar.

3) Click on the config button for the About Me widget (little notepad icon thingy on the right)

4) Enter the title you want visitors to see on the sidebar

5) Click in the editor window and start designing your own widget!!!

Put together a generic 'about me' design:

1) Select the image icon above the editor (looks like a tree)
     
2) Enter the URL (path) to the image (relative is fine, e.g.; /wp-content/uploads/portrait.jpg)
     
3) Enter Image Description, Title
     
4) Select the appearance tab and use the pull-down menu to apply an alignment class
     
5) Click the Update button
     
6) Back in the editor now, type some text (a blurb about yourself or your site).
     
7) Hi-lite the text and use the pull-down styles menu to apply alignment class/style
     
8) Add some links, if you wish, then repeat #7 to the link/anchor text.
     
9) Close the config window when you're finished and hit the Save Changes button
